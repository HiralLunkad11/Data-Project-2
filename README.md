What is the best way to choose the ideal film for a movie night? Should we take popularity, ratings, budget, personal interests, or something else into account? Python has been used by me to find connections between many factors, such as budget, popularity, gross revenue, etc.

The dataset can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/movies.



Conclusions:
Gross earnings and budget have a strong correlation.

Voting has a strong relationship with gross earnings.

Business and Gross Earnings don't really correlate.
